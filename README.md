# Object Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator
The objective of this project was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## User Story 

AS A manager<br />
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info<br />
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles <br />

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input<br />
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information<br />
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input<br />
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML<br />
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address<br />
WHEN I click on the GitHub username<br />
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab<br />
WHEN I start the application<br />
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number<br />
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number<br />
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team<br />
WHEN I select the engineer option<br />
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu<br />
WHEN I select the intern option<br />
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu<br />
WHEN I decide to finish building my team<br />
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated<br />
